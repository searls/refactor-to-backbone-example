# a little backbone refactor

Simple little repo demoing a refactor.

To get started, [install lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman), clone the repo, then run `npm install` inside the repository root directory.

If you run

```
$ lineman run --force
```

You'll see at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), a little example sign up page. It's implementation is in `app/js/sign-up.js`.

If you switch to the `backbone` branch (you'll need to restart lineman), the same toy app will have been refactored to basic backbone objects.
